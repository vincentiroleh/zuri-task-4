# Task Title: NodeJS File System Task

The aim of this task is to test how well you can research. You have learned about NodeJS file system. Read the following instructions carefully.

1. Create a script file that fetches data from JSON PLACEHOLDER POSTS
2. Write the JSON data gotten from the API to a file called posts.json or posts.txt
3. posts.json or post.txt should be in a directory file called result.
4. Create a github repository and push your work.

Submit the github link. Ensure that your repository isn't a private repository.

**HINT**: You can choose to use the Axios package if you want. I'd advise not to. If you choose to, do not push node_modules to your repo.
